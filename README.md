Main purpose of design is to make NAS with more reliable SATA connection comparing to USB-to-SATA converters. SATA controllers can be connected through MiniPCIe slot. There are variety of cards in market, mainly my intend was to use this for 2 SATA (see picture below). This is half size card. Cards for 4 SATA with RAID controller also can be connected.
